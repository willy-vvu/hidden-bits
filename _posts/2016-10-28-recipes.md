> What is a program?

In the common sense, a program comprises instructions for a computer, usually written in "computer code". But I'll define it more broadly, excluding mention of computers altogether.

> A program: instructions for how to a perform a process.

Notice how that description can describe, say, paragraphs in a textbook, directions to reach a destination, or steps in a culinary recipe, among many.

Sometimes I like to think about cooking and the sharing of recipes as the *"Open Source/Maker" movement before it's time*. Each "maker" in their "makerspace" (the kitchen) can recreate, customize, and remix recipes from the "maker" community, given the right ingredients.

Recipes, as "open source" "programs" written with the intention to be read and followed by another, have practically developed their own [syntax](https://books.google.com/books?id=zXVoAAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA161&ots=H-PntvONVH&dq=syntax%20of%20culinary%20recipes&pg=PA161#v=onepage&q=syntax%20of%20culinary%20recipes&f=false) over centuries of use.

```
You will need:
2 eggs
1 cup milk
2/3 cup flour

Mix ingredients in a blender.
Heat a skillet and brush with oil.
Pour 1/4 cup of batter into pan.
Cook 2 to 5 minutes, turning once, until golden.
Repeat with remaining batter.
```

Inspired by recipes, I embarked on an experiment to improve the readability of my code. I started with some observations about recipe use:

1. Recipes begin with a list of **initial ingredients**.
2. Each step of the recipe is a **transformation**, beginning with a verb.
3. Sometimes, a step requires **extra information** such time or temperature.

```
[1. Initial ingredients]

[2. Transformation as a verb] [3. Extra information if needed]
[2. Transformation as a verb] [3. Extra information if needed]
...more steps...
```


Each transform takes input from the intermediate product that came before it, yielding output for the next transform.

I'll take the example of computing the math expression `sqrt(4 ^ 3)`. A "recipe" in this format would look like:

```
Take 4
Exponentiate by 3
Take the Square Root
```

"But wait!" I'll hear some of you PureData/MaxMSP/LabView/Grasshopper/NodeFlo users shout, "isn't that like dataflow programming?"

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight">
<img alt="Representation of above recipe as PureData dataflow program" src="/hidden-bits/assets/16-10-28-dataflow.png">
</pre>
</div>

Indeed! Dataflow programming is a nice visual representation of programs as data transforms. However, they don't (yet) support anonymous and first class functions. It's also a bit more cumbersome to manipulate and type than text, being relatively mouse-heavy. However, this can vary based on editor design/implementation.

"Hmm..." you may ask, "what about notebook programming languages, like Mathematica, Maple, iPython, Carbide, or a good ol' REPL?"

```python
In[0]  = 4
Out[0] = 4

In[1]  = pow(Out[0], 3)
Out[1] = 64

In[2]  = sqrt(Out[1])
Out[2] = 8
```

Yes! This type of format is nice for mathematical computation, as it allows easy storage and manipulation of intermediate expressions. However, it's not as easy to propagate changes for inputs. Usually, many dependent cells must be re-run, which may also be an design/implementation decision.

To explore the initial "recipe-like" format, I designed and implemented a [helper library for Python](https://gist.github.com/willy-vvu/ca58bbe695c0ef1ed84fc7d9270542e1). Here's how the above would be rewritten using this library:

```python
(
  _(4)                # Ingredients
  ._(pow).ThatWith(3) # Transform, with extra information
  ._(sqrt)            # Transform, without extra information
  ()                  # Returns result
)
```

Note that references to the intermediate product are implicit, like in recipes: `the batter` can be omitted when stating `Cook 2 to 5 minutes, until golden`. When omitted, the result of the previous function is automatically provided as the last argument:

```python
._(method).With(1).With(2)
```

is equivalent to

```python
           With     With   That (implicit)
   method(   1    ,   2  ,   _  )
```

The `That` term serves as a mental stand-in as to where the previous function's result goes.

However, as argument order matters in Python, this warrants some extra (explicit) syntax.

```python
._(method).With(1).ThatWith(3)
```
is equivalent to

```python
           With    That  With
   method(   1    ,  _ ,   3 )
```

With this in mind, I've been writing my assignments exclusively using this library. Here's an example:

```python
def extensions(graph, path):
    """Returns a list of paths. Each path in the list should be a one-node
    extension of the input path, where an extension is defined as a path formed
    by adding a neighbor node (of the final node in the path) to the path.
    Returned paths should not have loops, i.e. should not visit the same node
    twice. The returned paths should be sorted in lexicographic order."""

    # Returns a list of paths.
    return (

      # Each path in the list should be a
      # one-node extension of the input path,
      # where an extension is defined as

      # a path formed by adding a neighbor node
      _(graph.get_neighbors)

      # (of the final node in the path)
      .With(path[-1])

      # to the path.
      ._(map).With(lambda node: path + [node])

      # Returned paths should not have loops
      # i.e. should not visit the same node twice.
      ._(filter).With(lambda path: not has_loops(path))

      # The returned paths should be sorted in lexicographic order.
      ._(sorted).ThatWith(key = "".join)

      ()
    )
```

Here are some observations, many of which streamline complaints in the [last post](/hidden-bits/2016/10/07/sustainable-code.html):

- Like recipes, function names now come after their arguments*, hopefully increasing readability.
- Use of Python's built-in methods (`map`, `filter`, `sorted`) supports code understanding.
- Functional programming remains, with "one-line" return statements.
- Fewer dangling parenthesis and ambiguous indentation, improving readability.
- Comments interspersed with code, supporting "Literate Programming".

<sup>*Well, the function names come after one of their arguments. This is a combination of reverse and partial function application, two functional-programming-inspired tricks under the hood.<sup>

I encourage you to continue to expand your definition of programming across contexts and domains. Even the ordinary, when viewed from a different angle, can seem completely foreign, strange, and novel. Who knows? Inspiration can come from the most unexpected of places.
