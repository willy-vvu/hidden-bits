*Here's a guest post from my friend, Prakhar Sahay.*

Human collaboration hasn’t reached its full potential yet. How do teachers and students communicate effectively? Or employers and employees? How about team members, coworkers, and even friends? How about large classes and organizations? These channels should be two-way, fast, and not block other channels. In addition, information conveyed through the channels should be simple and fast to view and contribute.

Any solution is a mixture of technology and soft skills training. Vocal conversations (calling, e-mail), video chats (Skype, FaceTime), and chatting apps (Slack, Messenger) are common technology alternatives to in-person conversations. Vocal and video conversations certainly aren’t adequate for sharing resources and storing the conversation itself. E-mail is a step closer but lacks the speed and clear format of chatting and commenting. Messenger recently ported the text search feature from Facebook and improved its shared photo gallery, but many types of files still can’t be sent across. Messenger also links to Facebook profiles and allows video calls. Slack has text search, attaching of any kind of file (as well as in-app viewing of several types) and now connects to Google Drive which stores a revision history. In addition to profiles, photo galleries, and video calls which Messenger features, reminders still have a way to go in Slack.

What about information-sharing systems? Any developer knows Stack Overflow for Q&A and GitHub for viewing and contributing code. Stack Exchange, Quora, and Wikipedia in general are powerful communities, and Academia is a growing community of researchers while academic journals and research labs design their own websites. My university uses Moodle, but often enough professors ignore Moodle and customize their own course websites using Rails, Google Sites, or 20th century HTML.

If we take a naïve approach and take the disjunction of the above tools, our technology solution includes a communication app which features:

- Video and written chat
- Searching text and files
- Pinging, seeing who’s online
- Scheduling meetings, deadlines, and reminders
- Assigning and nesting tasks

In addition to an information sharing app which features:

- Q&A forum/FAQ
- Documentation and profiles (for a team and their major objectives and products)
- File system (data, code, images) and meaningful ways of interacting with the files within the app
- File revision control and reviewing

Then there is the sharing of ideas. Emoticons and Messenger stickers don’t even scratch the surface of richer communication. Video captures body language; audio captures tone. Shared whiteboards let us draw our ideas out; screen-sharing lets us share an application’s exact behavior. And suddenly we’re hit with this wave of information software can’t yet represent past analog-to-digital conversion.

If my partner has three screens- streaming me, my screen, and a digital whiteboard, how do I communicate a complex diagram? I could attempt to sloppily draw it pixel-by-pixel, model it with my hands, or use software to draw it. A decent UML editor can partially afford me the last one, although they’re generally too restrictive in form for an abstract thought. But then we want to connect ideas and we’re stuck, because my UML editor isn’t going to link to my code files, let alone abstract parts of subroutines. Or images and datasets.

I’ve often found PowerPoint useful for such abstract static representations of ideas. But just that, static.  No interactivity, no modularization for reusability, no movement. And placing it on a communication channel – I think we can agree that Google Slides falls short of our naïve dream application from before.

Designing software to communicate and store our ideas is a nontrivial problem, and it’s only half the battle to effective human collaboration.
