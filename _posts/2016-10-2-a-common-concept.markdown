Recently, I've been thinking about thinking. I've asked myself more than many times: What is programming? Contrary to the title, this blog is not neccesarily about programming. Sometimes, it won't have anything to do with programming or bits. Nonetheless, it'll be tied together under a common concept.



From metabolic pathways to thought pathways, chemical reactions to emotional reactions, the processes that make us often lie beyond our sight. Why is it that we rarely stop to consider the digital fabric that surrounds us, to the civic network that supports us: silicon highways of information, copper highways of water and waste?

We more often come across their boundaries: forgotten memories and missing files, city limits and cell walls. Where does one process end and another begin? What makes the "other" different from the "self"? It is at these intersections that fabric frays, sidewalks end, and underlying processes begin to reveal themselves.

At these intersections, conversation is possible. It takes two to punctuate our otherwise singleton existence, to transcend the individual. We take a leap of faith, spreading our seeds far and wide in hopes they sow unto the fields of others. Sometimes, we wonder whether our own soils are refuge enough for weary saplings wandering our way.

Through sleepless nights and uninspired days, of recollected rumination and stale inspiration, by breaking prototypes and making broken prototypes, I know the journey will not be easy. I am willing to fight the mists of misunderstanding, the acids of assumption, the weeds of conventional wisdom. To plant this blog takes a leap of faith, one that may bear fruit in the future. If so, I can only hope its seeds take root and flourish in tender, fertile fields of another.
