*(Why do blog posts have to be long?)*

One question I've thought about before, and that I'll pose now is: How does it feel to write code across the  world, for someone who's native language isn't based on the Latin alphabet and/or is read right to left, for example? Of course comments can be in one's native language, provided there is adequate Unicode support, but does one still have to use English keywords/identifiers? How clunky would it feel if English speakers had to use [another language](http://animalnewyork.com/2014/artists-notebook-ramsey-nasser/) to write keywords such as `import`, `while`, `break`, and so forth?

At some level, these keywords are embedded in the parser of a programming language. What makes a language powerful is its ability to express concepts shared between two or more entities. Like a Venn diagram, a programming language's keywords have a common understanding between programmer and computer, allowing an accurate conveyance of a programmer's intentions into a computer's execution. Even though the keywords chosen could be [arbitrary](http://www.emojicode.org/), it helps to have a third intersection in the Venn diagram of understanding: one including the human language.

As for future thought: humans can actively acquire new linguistic structures and atoms (grammar and vocabulary) to expand their intersection of expressability with others, especially during development. Why can't computers do the same?
